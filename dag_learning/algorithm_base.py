class BaseAlgorithm:
    """
    "BaseAlgorithm" provides a basic framework of methods that all DAG learning algorithms must follow.
    All DAG learning algorithms should extend this class.

    In addition, a basic constructor is provided with most of the data required to be stored. Further
    information more specific to each algorithm (such as metrics or hyperparameters) should be specified
    either as a `build_dag` argument or as an extension of the constructor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: str, DataFrame or ndarray
        Dataset or location of the dataset from which the DAG will be built. The following can be specified:

        - A path to a .csv file
        - A DataFrame containing the data and variable names
        - A numpy Array containing the data

        If a numpy array is specified, the variable names MUST be passed as argument.
    nodes: list[str], optional
        List of ordered variable names contained within the data.
        This argument is ignored unless a numpy Array is given as data - in which case, it is mandatory.
    bayesian_network: BayesianNetwork or str, optional
        Bayesian Network (or path to the BIF file describing it) used for final measurements (like
        the log likelihood of the dataset)
    equivalent_sample_size: int, default=10
        Equivalent sample size used to compute BDeu scores.
    bdeu_score_method: {"forloop", "unique", "mask"}, default="unique"
        Method used to count state frequencies. Possible values:

            * "unique": np.unique over the sliced dataset
            * "forloop": Standard for loop
            * "mask": Masking to segment the dataset into smaller datasets with each parent state combinations

        "unique" should be used, other methods are kept for compatibilityâ€™s sake.
    results_path: str, optional
        Path to store the results logger file. If not specified, no logging will be done.
    input_file_name: str, optional
        Filename of the input data. Only used if data is not specified as a CSV and if results_path is not None.
    flush_frequency: int, default=300
        Time (in seconds) between results logger flushes / how often the file is written to.
